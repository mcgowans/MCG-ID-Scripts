# MCG ID Scripts
## InDesign Scripts by McGowans Print

This is a bunch of random scripts used by [McGowans Print](http://www.mcgowansprint.com)
in their prepress department.

As one of Ireland's busiest digital print providers, we're used to automating as many
tasks as possible. Over the years, we've built up a toolkit of InDesign scripts that have
proved useful to us, and now we're going to start sharing them publicly on GitHub under a
permissive MIT license.

Because they generally fall into the 'evolved' rather than 'planned' category, a lot of
them need some care and attention. Therefore, they won't be uploaded en masse. Instead,
we'll clean them up as we have time, and upload them when they're in reasonably good
shape.

### Contributions

Contributions are welcome. Before issuing a pull request, please familiarise yourself
with the general structure of other similar files we've uploaded, and try to follow a
similar approach. We'll figure out a formal style guide at a later date.

We use JavaScript here for cross-platform compatibility: no AppleScript/VBScript
contributions will be accepted at this time.

If you want to get involved, there are a few options open to you:

* Install and use our scripts! The more people that use them, the more improvements
there'll be.
* Check out our [Issues page](https://github.com/mcgowans/MCG-ID-Scripts/issues).
You can raise feature requests, bug reports, or even help fix a few issues yourself!
* Add documentation or examples;
* Spread the word...
